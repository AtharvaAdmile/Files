#Theory:
MBA:
Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is a data mining technique used to discover purchase patterns in transaction data — specifically, which products are frequently bought together.
It analyzes a customer’s shopping cart (or "basket") to identify relationships between items.
The goal is to uncover association rules, like:

“Customers who buy bread and butter are likely to buy milk.

FP Growth:
FP-Growth (Frequent Pattern Growth) is an efficient and scalable method for frequent itemset mining, used as an alternative to the Apriori algorithm in market basket analysis.

It’s faster and more memory-efficient than Apriori because it avoids generating candidate itemsets explicitly.

How FP-Growth Works (Step-by-Step)
Step 1: Count item frequencies
Scan the dataset once to count the frequency (support) of each item.

Discard items not meeting minimum support.

Sort the remaining items by frequency (descending).

Step 2: Build FP-Tree (Frequent Pattern Tree)
Each transaction is inserted into the tree following the order of sorted frequent items.

Common prefixes are shared in branches, reducing redundancy.

Each node contains:

Item name

Count (number of transactions with that path)

Links to same items (for quick access)

Step 3: Mine Frequent Itemsets
Start from the lowest frequent items (in reverse order).

Construct conditional FP-trees for each item:

These trees are built from paths in the main FP-tree that end with that item.

Recursively mine patterns from these conditional trees.

Types of MBA:
1. Descriptive Market Basket Analysis
📌 Purpose:
To identify patterns in historical transaction data.

Finds frequent itemsets and association rules without predicting future behavior.

🔍 Example:
"Customers who bought bread also bought butter 60% of the time."

2. Predictive Market Basket Analysis
📌 Purpose:
To predict customer behavior based on previous transactions or current activity.

Often used in recommendation systems.

🔍 Example:
"If a customer added milk and cornflakes to the cart, suggest banana."
